# MastodonTranslate

## A quick/dirty tampermonkey script to add a Translate Toot option to toots

### Install

To install this script head to: https://github.com/tomouchuu/mastodon-translate/raw/master/index.user.js

### Limitations

* ~~Will only work on niu.moe instance~~ Kinda fixed - [#2](https://github.com/tomouchuu/mastodon-translate/issues/2)

### What it does

Upon clicking the ellipsis (...) you should see an option to translate toot, click this will translate the toot into english by default. To change this to your desired language, head to your mastodon preferences in settings and you should see an option for translate language. Select the language you'd like and then save changes, head back to the feed and refresh the page.
